Web3Auth is where passwordless auth meets non-custodial key infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets and innovative Multi Party Computation (MPC) - Web3Auth provides a seamless login experience to every user on your application.

## üí≠ Choosing Between SDKs

For using Web3Auth in the web, you have two choices of SDKs to get started with.

[Web3Auth Plug and Play UI SDK `@web3auth/modal`](https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/web3auth/): A simple and easy to use SDK that will give you a simple modular way of implementing Web3Auth directly within your application. You can use the pre-configured Web3Auth Modal UI and whitelabel it according to your needs.

[Web3Auth Plug and Play Core SDK `@web3auth/core`](https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/core/): The core module implemeting all the Web3Auth features you need and giving you the flexibilty of using your own UI with the Web3Auth SDK working in the backend.

[Web3Auth Backend SDK `@web3auth/node-sdk`](https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web-backend/): A simple and easy to use SDK to be used in your Node.js backend to get the same experience of Web3Auth frontend SDKs

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Installation (Web3Auth Backend)

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/node-sdk
```

### Get your Client ID from Web3Auth Dashboard

Hop on to the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) and create a new project. Use the Client ID of the project to start your integration.

### Initialize Web3Auth for your preferred blockchain

Web3Auth needs to initialise as soon as your app loads up to enable the user to log in. Preferably done within a constructor, initialisation is the step where you can pass on all the configurations for Web3Auth you want. A simple integration for Ethereum blockchain will look like this:

```js
import { Web3Auth } from "@web3auth/node-sdk";
import { EthereumPrivateKeyProvider } from "@web3auth/ethereum-provider";

//Initialize within your constructor
const web3auth = new Web3Auth({
  clientId: "", // Get your Client ID from Web3Auth Dashboard
  web3AuthNetwork: "mainnet",
  usePnPKey: false, // Setting this to true returns the same key as PnP Web SDK. 
  // By default, this SDK returns CoreKitKey.
});

const chainConfig: {
  displayName: "ETH Mainnet",
  blockExplorer: "https://etherscan.io",
  ticker: "ETH",
  tickerName: "Ethereum",
  chainId: "0x1",
  rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth", // needed for non-other chains
};

const provider = new EthereumPrivateKeyProvider({ config: { chainConfig } })

web3auth.init({ provider });
```

### Login your User

Once you're done initialising, logging in is as easy as:

```js
await web3auth.connect({
  verifier: "verifier-name",
  verifierId: "verifier-Id",
  idToken: "JWT Token",
});
```

## ‚è™ Requirements

- Node 14+
